# Cytohubb-UP
Computational analysis of autophagy genes in human senescence

•By using cytoHubba, selected the top 10 genes and groupedthem using MCODE. 
•The results show MTOR and BECN1 in both categories based on MCC attributes. 
•Running workflows to focus on the important signalling pathways, molecular activities, and biological processes involving these autophagy regulating genes
